        <h2>I’m Truly Sorry</h2>
        <p>I can’t begin to express how much it hurts me that I let you down. Every word, every action I did that caused you pain... it breaks my heart to know that I hurt the person I care about most in the world. I know words can’t always make things better, but I want you to know that I’m committed to learning, growing, and becoming a better partner. You deserve nothing less than my very best, and I promise to do better, for you and for us.</p>

        <p>Do you remember the first time we talked? How i made you laugh about the silly things hehe our time together has been the most beautiful adventure of my life alhamdulillah. We’ve built so many wonderful memories, and I want to keep making more with you.</p>

        <h2>Forever Yours</h2>
        <p>I know that I can’t take back what I did, but I will spend every day trying to be the partner you deserve. I love you more than words can say, and I’ll always cherish you. Please forgive me, my love.</p>
